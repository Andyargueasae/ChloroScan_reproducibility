# ChloroScan_code
Codes used in the ChloroScan benchmarking and data preparations. 

 - Bash commands used in generating synthetic metagenomes and benchmarking ChloroScan: ``benchmarking_codes.md``. Codes such as downloading NCBI dataset genomes, running binning benchmarking and running binning tools (MetaBAT2/ChloroScan) are here.

 - Commands used in generating marker gene database: ``marker_gene_database_commands.md``. Codes used for reproducing a marker gene database are here.
 
 - OrthoFinder outputs and the scripts and files involved in generating the marker gene database are dumped here: https://doi.org/10.26188/28722788. A copy of all result files and intermediary files for generating marker gene database is in ``marker_gene_database_files.tar.gz``. Before running codes in ``./codes/marker_gene_database_commands.md``, please download the required datasets from here.
